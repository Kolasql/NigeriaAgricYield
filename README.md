### Data Wrangling Process
"""
Data was compiled from 2 primary sources: USDA and FAO.
The dependent variable was sourced from the USDA website, while majority of the predictive features was sourced from the FAO.
Data on the percentage of female employment in agriculure was absent until 1991, hence, the missing data was filled with the 3rd quartile.
The female demography hold a significant proportion of the workforce, most especially in the agricultural sector.
